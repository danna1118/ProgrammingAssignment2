The Harvard Innovation Labs is a unique collaboration and education space designed to foster entrepreneurship and innovation across Harvard. A leading example of the power of One Harvard, the i-lab also serves as the gateway to Harvard University’s expanding Allston campus and its vision to become a truly cross-disciplinary research and innovation focused learning and development community.

A Distinctive Approach
As an entrepreneurship center, the i-lab is unique in its accessibility. The i-lab is open to any student from any Harvard school with any idea at any stage of formation. Every semester cross-university student teams apply to participate in the Venture Incubation Program, a 12-week integrated program that combines mentoring, workshops and community to help the teams move their startup ideas “further, faster.” Post-graduation select teams and other qualified applicants move onto the Launch Lab, a prototype co-working space and program of funded alumni ventures.

Expansive Programming and Resources
The i-lab offers a five-stage engagement model focused on foundational and experiential learning that enables students to explore entrepreneurship, meet and engage with a growing community of first-time founders and experienced entrepreneurs, ideate in human-centric ways, prototype and build to test the practicality of their visions, and launch and grow their ventures.

Along the way students are able to tap into the i-lab’s extensive connections to the regional and national startup ecosystem, gaining access to expertise and guidance across a broad range of topics and industry areas including health and science, technology, cultural entrepreneurship, social impact, and consumer brands.

Looking Ahead
There has never been a better time to be a part of innovation at Harvard. And the i-lab has an unprecedented opportunity to continue to shape cross-disciplinary collaboration at Harvard and serve as a catalyst to solving society’s most pressing needs through innovation and entrepreneurship
